# firkin

storage, aging, and access for small structured data

### Adding firkin to your project:

Use the following resolver:
``` scala
resolvers += "Will's bintray" at "https://dl.bintray.com/willb/maven/"

```

To use a firkin server:

``` scala
libraryDependencies += "com.freevariable" %% "firkin" % "0.2.1"
```

To use a firkin client:

``` scala
libraryDependencies += "com.freevariable" %% "firkin-client" % "0.2.1"
```

### usage

Fire up a Firkin server with 

    com.freevariable.firkin.Firkin.start()(colossus.IOSystem())

or `sbt server/console`.

You'll then have a server running on port 4091.  You can store and access data via the following HTTP routes:

* `POST /cache` with a payload of JSON data:  this will store the object you provided and redirect you to its location in the cache
* `GET /cache`:  this will return a list of all the hashes currently in the cache
* `GET /cache/$HASH`:  this will return the object in the cache with hash `$HASH` or 404
* `POST /tag` with a payload of JSON data containing a `tag` field and a `hash` field:  this will create a _tag_ mapping from the value of the tag field to the document with the given hash, redirecting you to a URI for this tag.  The document with the given `hash` must exist.
* `GET /tag/$TAG`: this will resolve the tag given by `$TAG` and redirect you to the document it points to (returning 404 if there is no such tag)

Submitting empty POST data or submitting invalid JSON as POST data will result in various 4xx errors.

To interact with Firkin using `curl`, try the following:

    % curl -i -d '{"foo":"bar"}' http://localhost:4091/cache
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Location: http://localhost:4091/cache/a5e744d0164540d33b1d7ea616c28f2fa97e754a
    Content-Length: 0
    
    % curl http://localhost:4091/cache/a5e744d0164540d33b1d7ea616c28f2fa97e754a
    {"foo":"bar"}
    
    % curl http://localhost:4091/cache/
    {"cachedKeys":["a5e744d0164540d33b1d7ea616c28f2fa97e754a"]}
    
    % curl -i -d '{"tag":"foobar", "hash":"a5e744d0164540d33b1d7ea616c28f2fa97e754a"}' http://localhost:4091/tag
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Location: http://localhost:4091/tag/foobar
    Content-Length: 0
    
    % curl -L -i http://localhost:4091/tag/foobar                              2015-05-19 10:42:01 willb ttys000
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Location: http://localhost:4091/cache/a5e744d0164540d33b1d7ea616c28f2fa97e754a
    Content-Length: 0
    
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Length: 13
    
    {"foo":"bar"}
        

To interact with Firkin using its Scala client library, try the following:

    scala> val client = new com.freevariable.firkin.Client("localhost", 4091)
    client: com.freevariable.firkin.Client = com.freevariable.firkin.Client@3f342608

    scala> client.put("""{"foo": "bar"}""")
    res0: String = http://localhost:4091/cache/a5e744d0164540d33b1d7ea616c28f2fa97e754a
    
    scala> client.getOrElse("a5e744d0164540d33b1d7ea616c28f2fa97e754a", "sorry!")
    res1: String = {"foo":"bar"}
    
    scala> client.putTag("foobar", "a5e744d0164540d33b1d7ea616c28f2fa97e754a")
    
    scala> client.getTag("foobar")
    res2: Option[String] = Some({"foo":"bar"})
    
    scala> client.publish("foobar-2", """{"foo": "bar"}""")
    res0: String = http://localhost:4091/tag/foobar-2


### answers to frequently anticipated questions

1.  A firkin is 4.091 L but we can't have fractional ports.
2.  In order:  it's useful to have a sink for relatively small structured data that you generate with one thing and want to consume with another.  Also: NIH.
